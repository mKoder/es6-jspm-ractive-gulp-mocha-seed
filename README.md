# Seed / example project with ES6, JSPM, RACTIVE, GULP, KARMA, MOCHA

I wanted to create a project which gave me a full workflow using ES6 with traspilation
to ES5, a build process, and unit testing.
JSPM is a great tool (http://jspm.io/). It gives you great package management with the
huge added benefit of being build on ES6 module loader and includes a transpiler. I wasn't
though seeing any examples of how to use this in a full workflow with a build & test step.
This project combines JSPM with gulp, and mocha. It provides an example app which loads
data from reddit, transforms it using ES6 lib functions, and displays it.
For the view I wanted to try some out some modern performant UI libraries. I started off
by looking at React, but I found i really didn't like the look of JSX and the way the markup
is embedded with the JS. I feel that in order to support a lean UX methodology, templates
really need to be kept simple, and separate
